## Koru Impact – Foundational Website

This repository contains the static website for Koru Impact, developed as part of the Foundational Technologist Assessment.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to deliver a responsive and professional static website that represents Koru Impact’s mission, services, and values. The site structure includes:

index.html – Home Page

about.html – About Page

services.html – Services Page

contact.html – Contact Page

The design emphasizes accessibility, responsiveness, and clarity.

## Deployment
The site is deployed via GitHub Pages. You can view it live at:
https://ilkekanil.github.io/koru-impact-website/

## Custom Domain Acknowledgment
Connecting the site to the official domain (koruimpact.org) requires access to the domain’s DNS settings. Since I do not own this domain, the final DNS verification could not be completed. If access is granted, the domain can be connected by adding the provided GitHub TXT record to the DNS configuration.
